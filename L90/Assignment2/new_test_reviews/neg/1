Overacting Galore. I was underwhelmed - to say it friendly - but not surprised by the fact. Because Hollywood has lost its magic looong time ago. IMHO no. bo. dy gives a damn about Darth Vader's Childhood or Joker's relationship with his mother. All we want for centuries is a proper boogeyman. If you overpaid LaLaLand-Schmocks won't jump from the stupid Prequel-explains-it-all-train - please give us at least solid filmmaking. Joker is a mess. No story, no finesse, no build-up, no surprises, no ideas. But a load of layman-psychology that should make even 12y olds roll their eyes; a cacophony of more or less unrelated scenes; cheesy taxi-driver-moments without any impact; massive overacting by Phoenix and no subtle sinister Joker moments except for the two second Elevator-Scene we all know (and love) from the trailer. rating 9.0? A joke. Heath Ledger, I miss you.
