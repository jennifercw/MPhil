The Joke(r) is on Us! The Batsuit can deflect bullets, but it can't withstand a dog attack? Holy Wardrobe Malfunction! If I were Bruce Wayne, I would have kicked Morgan Freeman's backside back to The Electric Company, and sued the crap out of the firm that made the material that was supposed to protect my richer-than-God self from the likes of Cujo! But then, that would make way too much sense, and "sense" is something that the Batman franchise has never been accused of having! Say what you will about Tim Burton's and Joel Schumacher's Batman movies: at least they never pretended to be anything other than silly popcorn flicks. Christopher Nolan, on the other hand, wants to be Ingmar Bergman when he grows up -- which is why he rips off Burton! Don't tell me that ridiculous standoff was a happy accident, Ledger grunting "Come on, come on, hit me" Ã  la Jack? Batman doesn't turn The Joker into roadkill because he has a moral code? Give me a break! And, for a self-proclaimed "agent of chaos", every one of The Joker's actions are oddly well-planned and executed. Memo to Nolan: look up "chaos" in the dictionary! Which leads me to Ledger. Since when does twitching like a coked-up Mexican jumping bean constitute acting? No disrespect, but let's be real: if he hadn't died, that truly morbid Oscar campaign wouldn't have sprung up, and he wouldn't have been nominated, much less, won. As I could never understand Ledger half the time because none of his directors had the balls to tell him to enunciate like a normal human being, he had to have been dubbed, because I actually understood every word he said! And it's "close to the vest", NOT "close to the chest"! Idiots!
