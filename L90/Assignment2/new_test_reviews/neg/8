Over-hyped....I must be missing something. Finally got to see this - I was disappointed. I haven't been this bored in a movie in quite awhile (not since Titanic at least). Heath Ledger's turn as the Joker was fine, but come on, I hate to say this, but are people saying his performance was a "tour de force" because the performance was so outstanding (it wasn't) or because he died prematurely (it was). The movie was dark, plodding, and overly long. There were some tense moments (ie: the ferry boats), and some of the twists and turns were interesting enough, but not enough to sustain this dank, overloaded barge. Time is always the true test of worth, and like Titanic, this movie will not hold up.
