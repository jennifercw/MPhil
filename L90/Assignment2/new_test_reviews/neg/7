Not even the best movie of 2008. To start, I would like to say that this movie is not even as good as Batman Begins. Christian Bale is one of my favorite actors, Batman is one of the best super heroes, but that still does not mean this equates to The Shawshank Redemption or The Godfather. This is a very good movie, but it is not deserving of all of the hype surrounding it. Health Ledger's death had more of an impact on this movie's critical acclaim than anything in the actual movie. The Joker is pretty cool because the screen writers made him cool, not because Health Ledger delivered an Oscar worthy performance or any of that other BS. People seem to forget that Liam Neeson played his character in Begins at least as well if not better than Heath Ledger played The Joker. Also, Christian Bale is predominately playing his snobby Bruce Wayne character in this film, which is quite annoying. After seeing the movie, you might even realize that Christian Bale's obscure placement throughout the film is a major flaw. The Godfather is around 3 hours, this is around 2&1/2 hours, yet this movie feels much slower. Rather than keeping a steady pace, the movie seems to doze off for a while followed by huge explosions and overly drawn out 30 minute action sequences. It's ridiculous. The best movie of 2008 is In Bruges, not TDK.
