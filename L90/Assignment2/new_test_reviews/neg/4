Money (That's What Danny-Boy Wants). Not even the Beatles music could save this garbage. "Yesterday" is about a mediocre musician that, after an accident, is the only person that remembers the Beatles. Why's that? We don't receive any explanation. The film, instead of focusing on the cultural impact on such an event, decides to be another awful romantic comedy. Our main character is a whiny little biatch, that complaints about not being recognized for his "talent", and that only rise to success after stealing the Beatles songs. Let's face something, if the Beatles were formed today...no one would pay attention, that's the sad truth, because everyone is a normie that only listens to trap or reggaeton or garbage like that. And people would care less if the Beatles were only Himesh Patel (ugh). This man is the most uncarismatic person ever, my toe has more personality than him. All the music of the Beatles is butchered, literally the man can't sing, and the arrangements for the songs are atrocious or mediocre. But the biggest problem of the movie is a woman called Lily James. Her character is the worst person ever put on screen. I can't describe how horrible she is, you have to watch the movie, all i'm going to say is that she's basically the antagonist. Lily James>Hitler, yes she's more evil, that's all. At the end of the day, what Yesterday teaches us is that: a) If you have talent for something, you're a bad person that should only live in mediocrity. b) If you have a dream, forget about it, because you should not be successful. c) You can't have ambition, because you would be greedy. d) A crazy woman should control your life. e) Ed Sheeran needed promotion for his music. f) Danny Boyle has lost its touch.
