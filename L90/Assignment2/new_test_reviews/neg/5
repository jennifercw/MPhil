Terribly bad. This movie pulls out all the stops... horrible horrible storyline, terribly bad humor, cringeworthy characters and impressively mediocre cinematography. The only redeeming quality is that the songs are performed kind of okay. I cannot believe I spend money on this disaster and I cannot believe people are rating this monstrosity so high.
