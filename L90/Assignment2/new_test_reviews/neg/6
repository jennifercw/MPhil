Boring as hell. If you're going to make a bloody movie about Beatles songs, put a song in every scene. The entire middle part put me to sleep. Actually it uplifted me at first and I was laughing and laughing til after about 30 minutes. It seems that the director didn't know how to keep the excitement level up. It was boring as hell and I never want to see it again. Anyone who says it was good throughout the entire movie is nuts. They're just trying to be nice.
