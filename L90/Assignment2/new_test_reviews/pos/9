Superhero Genre - Alive and kicking. First I'd controversially like to point out that this movie wouldn't have gotten as much hype as it did if it wasn't for Heath Ledgers death before the release and the Academy not being afraid to give an Oscar to a corpse. Nevertheless his performance is easily the best one in the superhero genre and the crafty, well put together New York accent confirms he put a lot of dedication and effort into his methodical role and deserved what he got (an Oscar). This isn't just another Batman movie anymore. Yes, there is action, explosions and stunt work but between that is masterfully crafted dialogue that dwells deep. Batman is his definitive self now, we finally see the fullest of his character and Christian Bale does him justice. Christopher Nolan, praised be created complex characters and given each one justifiable treatment. That's the reason the cast works, everyone holds their own, there are no lazily written or neglected characters. With beautiful cinematography and presentation of Gotham, the visuals and obviously the endeavours cast The Dark Knight is a film that easily gets on top of every superhero list and is certainly one to remember... remember for a long time. Final Grade: 9/10
