# L90 Assignment 2

This project was undertaken for Assignment 2 of L90: Introduction to Natural Language Processing as part of MPhil Advanced Computer Science (2019/20).

## How to Run

Running this code will require installation of gensim, sklearn and nltk.

Running this code will require access to the training data both for the SVMs and for the doc2vec models.

This code should be run using Python3.

## Additional Downloads

The files for the doc2vec embeddings and for the saved SVM models are too large for easy storage on Github, so they can be downloaded at the following link:

The reviews used to train the doc2vec models can be found here:
